Project Title: Diwali Sales Analysis and Customer Segmentation

Description:
This project aims to analyze a dataset of Diwali sales, focusing on customer segmentation based on key factors like age, purchase amount, marital status, and product category. The project leverages K-Means clustering to identify distinct customer groups, offering insights into spending patterns and demographics. The analysis includes steps like data preprocessing, standardization, and visualization to understand the key segments and customer behavior.

Libraries Used:

pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing
sklearn: For clustering (KMeans) and preprocessing (StandardScaler, LabelEncoder)
matplotlib and seaborn: For visualizations
Steps:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Categorical data transformation and standardization.
K-Means Clustering: Elbow method to identify the optimal number of clusters.
Visualization: Scatter plot to represent customer segments based on age and amount spent.
Cluster Profiling: Analyzing characteristics of different clusters.
Key Features:

Customer segmentation based on age, amount spent, and marital status.
Optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.
Visualization of customer segments to understand market trends.
